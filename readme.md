Untitled Keyboard
=

First couple steps of a new keyboard, loosely based on Sofle, ErgoDash & ErgoDox.
For a first-phase and to test everything out, rev 0.x will be a macro-pad that can combine with another to validate ergo-split logic.
- 2x2 matrix w/ encoder knob/switch
- Connects to second board via J1 for 2x4 total
- Optional backlight LED string via J3
- Rows 3-5 & cols 4-7 unused for this design
- Final design will be 5x7, except zxcv row w/ 8
